# Video Chat 

- Simple Version of Video Chat like zoom/google-meet
- Project is just fun for accessing video, microphone from browsers and managing them with node.js,peer.js and css grid

## Workflow :

- It works the same as first we call the web site as https://localhost. 
- This starts a meet and changes the url to https://localhost?roomId="UUID".
- We can share this link with roomId with friends and enjoy the meet.

## Future Scopes :

- Add functionality to mute/unmute and to hide/show window.
- Add User authentication for the system.
- Add multiple ways to login to the meet like,
  - login with generated url with encrypted passcode.
  - login with meeting ID and passcode.
- Add a functionality to share a meeting ID directly from the web site.
- Add Chat Window.
- Integrate it with calendars.
- Add waiting room. 
- Add Netwwork quality checker.
- Add a feature to change background.

There is a vast scope for this topic of video chat as it has evolved alot due to work from home culture developed due to COVID-19
